# Project_NZ_News

In order to attain a passing grade in Web Development papers at Techtorium, I had to create a website to inform users about current events. These events comprised of technology | sports | travel | Middle East | business.  Furthermore, an advertisement section that advertised for Zara, H&M and Life Insurance. This project is 2 of 3 projects one had to produce and fill in all requirements.
